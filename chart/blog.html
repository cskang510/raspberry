            <br>
            <span>The plants are doing well, but given the variety and number, it's hard to keep up with when each of them needs to </span>
            <span>get watered. Based on "feel", I have been watering them approximately every other day, but given that I'm trying </span>
            <span>trying to create a fully automated garden, I want to have some way to have technology help. My solution is to create </span>
            <span>an app for this starting with detecting how moist the soil is.</span><br>
            <br>
            <span>The first step is in adding a new moisture sensor to the garden, so I purchased a YL-69 sensor and connected it to the </span>
            <span>raspberry pi that also runs the camera on the end. Here's a photo of it wired on a breadboard, running through a ADC </span>
            <span>Analog Digital Converter.</span>

          <p>
            <h4 class="featurette heading">January 22, 2016</h4>
            <br>
            <span>This weekend I'm going to make some changes to the garden based on what's working and what needs improvement. The first </span>
            <span>area of focus is around the lighting as I don't believe that the florescent lights are strong enough to grow all of these </span>
            <span>plant types. I've added two TaoTronics E27 12W Led Lights to enhance the light spectrum, which focus on the Red & Blue </span>
            <span>colors. The unit contains twelve 1W LED bulbs, three at 660nm, six at 630nm, and three at 460nm. The lamps rate at </span>
            <span>300mA, and yield 4530 Lux from five feet away. Given the low wattage and current, I don't expect a change in temperatures.</span><br>
            <br> 
            <span>Other changes will be to label the plants as I'm starting to get two waves of growth schedules, so labeling will help organize </span>
            <span>them, and finally I will change the humidity and temperature sensor to be mounted independently of the breadboard, so I'll </span>
            <span>be getting out the soldering iron.</span><br>
            <br>
            <span>On the botany front, the second wave of cilantro has now germinated, so I've taken off the celophane and will expose it </span>
            <span>directly to air while also improving the visuals. The other plants continue to do well, with new height with the tomato plants, </span>
            <span>and the lettuce are adding length to their leaves.</span><br>

            <br>
            <span>In an attempt to get some images captured of the photos when I'm out of town, I've now permanently mounted the camera at the end of the </span>
            <span>growing area, and have written another app that will relay the photos out to AWS, and overlay them onto the home page as well as off into </span>
            <span>an archive folder. Initial setting is for them to be taken every three hours, including overnight. It should give the ability to create </span>
            <span>timeseries photos showing the plants growing over time.</span><br>
            <br>
            <span>Looking at the photo below, you can tell that the lettuce continues to perk up (light green leaves on left side) and the tomato plants </span>
            <span>are growing well on the bottom right side of the image. The tallest is more than an inch, and the leaves are noticably getting longer as well. </span>
            <span>The beans are in the back right, and continue to be very wilted. The cilantro is in the back left, and difficult to see from this angle. </span>
            <span>What remains covered is the secon wave of cilantro that was planted five days ago.</span><br>
            <br>
            <span>I will be working on some sort of labeling scheme that will assist tracking of these going forward, and hopefully in a few weeks there will be </span>
            <span>plenty of growth to capture!</span>

            <span>Once again, it only took a few days for the lettuce plants to germinate, so a replacement wave of plants are available in case those </span>
            <span>that were dried out earlier in the week don't make it. I've uncovered them, and there are plenty of small leaves now visible. The </span>
            <span>cilantro haven't yet surfaced, but they were several days behind the lettuce with the first round, so I'd expect them to peak through </span>
            <span>later this week.</span><br>
            <br>
            <span>The garden does seem to have stabilized, with the plants now being watered approximately every other day. I've only gotten rid of four </span>
            <span>plants damaged from the drought, and while the beans are taking a while to bounce back, an additional round of leaves are beginning to form </span>
            <span>so perhaps they remain relatively unharmed.</span>

            <span>The plants are proving to be quite resilient, as most have started to bounce back from the drought in the first part of the week. The tomatoes </span>

            <h4 class="featurette heading">January 13, 2016</h4>
            <br>
            <span>I had a setback with the garden today as it got too dry, and ended up wilting most of the plants. Its too early how many of them are lost, but </span>
            <span>the picture below looks rather bleak. With the lowering of the bulbs over the lettuce and cilantro, it potentially was creating a warm zone </span>
            <span>and I was out of town for two days for work and didn't get a chance to catch it until now.</span><br>
            <br>
            <span>Based on the damage assessment, I started some additional plants from seed to replace some of the damaged crop. Twelve cilantro and lettuce plants </span>
            <span>were started from the original packs of seed, and placed into the growing area.</span><br>
            <br>
            <span>This will be a good test to determine what additional monitoring would be helpful as its a great condition to check for, and will motivate me </span>
            <span>to get the camera automated to take photos periodically vs. manually. Having more insight into how the plants looked like over the past 48 hours </span>
            <span>would be good to see the limits, and if there is some correlation to the humidity.</span>

            <br>
            <span>The plants have continued to grow, but I've noticed that the lettuce leaves seem a little weak. After researching some, I'm concluding </span>
            <span>that they are potentially not getting enough intensity of the lighting. Given that the lights are on chains, I rearranged the small plants </span>
            <span>enabling me to lower the blubs to about six inches above the lettuce and cilantro. Now for some observation this week and we'll see if this </span>
