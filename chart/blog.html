            <span>to recover, and the beans are those that continue to look rough, but appear to have new leaves beginning to form.</span>

            <br>
            <span>I had a setback with the garden today as it got too dry, and ended up wilting most of the plants. Its too early how many of them are lost, but </span>
            <span>the picture below looks rather bleak. With the lowering of the bulbs over the lettuce and cilantro, it potentially was creating a warm zone </span>
            <span>and I was out of town for two days for work and didn't get a chance to catch it until now.</span><br>
            <br>
            <span>Based on the damage assessment, I started some additional plants from seed to replace some of the damaged crop. Twelve cilantro and lettuce plants </span>
            <span>were started from the original packs of seed, and placed into the growing area.</span><br>
            <br>
            <span>This will be a good test to determine what additional monitoring would be helpful as its a great condition to check for, and will motivate me </span>
            <span>to get the camera automated to take photos periodically vs. manually. Having more insight into how the plants looked like over the past 48 hours </span>
            <span>would be good to see the limits, and if there is some correlation to the humidity.</span>

            <br>
            <span>The plants have continued to grow, but I've noticed that the lettuce leaves seem a little weak. After researching some, I'm concluding </span>
            <span>that they are potentially not getting enough intensity of the lighting. Given that the lights are on chains, I rearranged the small plants </span>
            <span>enabling me to lower the blubs to about six inches above the lettuce and cilantro. Now for some observation this week and we'll see if this </span>
            <span>changes the growth any.</span>

            <br>
            <span>In an attempt to create warmer growing conditions, I've now added insulation around the growing area. I purchased a roll of Reflectix </span>
